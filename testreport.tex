\chapter{\textbf{Introduction}}
\section{Introduction}
KiCad is an open-source software tool for the creation of electronic schematic diagrams and PCB artwork.KiCad can be considered mature enough to be used for the successful development and maintenance of complex electronic boards.KiCad does not present any board-size limitation and it can easily handle up to 32 copper layers, up to 14 technical layers and up to 4 auxiliary layers. KiCad can create all the files necessary for building printed boards, Gerber files for photo-plotters, drilling files, component location files and a lot more.Being open source (GPL licensed), KiCad represents the ideal tool for projects oriented towards the creation of electronic hardware with an open-source flavour.

Stable builds
Stable releases of KiCad can be found in most distributionâ€™s package managers as kicad and kicad-doc. If your distribution does not provide latest stable version, please follow the instruction for unstable builds and select and install the latest stable version.

Unstable (nightly development) builds
Unstable builds are built from the most recent source code. They can
sometimes have bugs that cause file corruption, generate bad gerbers, etc, but are generally stable and have the latest  features.

\chapter{\textbf{SUBCIRCUIT BUILDER METHOD}}
\section{SUBCIRCUIT BUILDER METHOD}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subcircuits are used to create large components from simple components.
\item Since most Kicad components such as nand gates,flip flops etc need netlists for them to function,we have found that the subcircuit method is most successful for create netlists for circuits which we want to add
\item Most digital circuits in Kicad nightly builds can be built by the method of subcircuit.
\item To explain the concept of subcircuit,I will take example of  creating a nand gate using cmos logic
\item First create a nand gate using cmos logic and basic devices as shown in figure below.
\begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{20.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Generate netlist and simulate.Check whether waveforms are correct.
\item Now open a new project and click on create,editor delete symbol in toolbox
\begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{21.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Next click on create a new library to store all your subcircuit files
\item Select symbol  libray table to add symbol select project
\begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{22.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Click on create new symbol and select the subcircuit file you have created 
\begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{23.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Create the new subcircuit using toolbox provided in the right as shown in figure below
 \begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{24.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Next step is to create a subckt file for cmos$\_$nand using the netlist generated copy the contents as highlighted in the figure below
 \begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{25.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Next create a subcircuit  .lib file for the netlist generated using .subckt and adding pin numbers.Make sure pin numbers for subcircuit is same as that provided for the circuit.Use globel labels for providing pin numbers.Generated subcircuit would look as follows.
 \begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{26.png}
\end{flushleft}
\item Now you are free to use the subcircuit created by you and use it as a component for the required functionality.

\chapter{\textbf{Problems faced and their solutions}}
\section{Problems faced and their solutions}
Problem:Circuits consisting of diodes were not giving correct waveforms.

Solution:Since diode is a basic component there is no need of a .lib file added to it.However we must interchange the position of the pins for the diode to work correctly.For Zener diode we must both interchange position and add netlist
\begin{flushleft}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{42.png}
\end{flushleft}

Problem:Some circuits involving transistors,op amps,zener diodes were not  producing correct waveforms.

Solution:Add the corresponding netlist for each of these devices.You may have to build the netlist if it is not available or use subcircuit builder method.

Problem:We were not aware on how to give value for pwl sources

Solution:We have to add a delay whenever there is a transition

Problem:Digital circuits were not working properly

Solution:Use subcircuit builder method
